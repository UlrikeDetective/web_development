# A thousand Colors (HTML)

A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/JjXVRbR](https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/JjXVRbR).

A comprehensive, filterable, searchable HTML database of 1000 colors,  via  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_colors

The Sort field allows you to sort by Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Brightness (Value), and  Red, Green, and Blue percentages.

The Search field allows you to quickly find colors by name, and is full regex, so it's possible to use | for simple 'or' queries to see multiple colors together "red|blue",  or even more advanced patterns like "colors that start and end with same letter" :  "^(\w).*\1$". 

The optional Webmaster toggle shows common CSS value strings for every color, including 'web short name' if present.
