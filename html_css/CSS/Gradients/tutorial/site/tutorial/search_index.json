Q: Why is my gradient not showing up? A: Check your syntax. Ensure you are using the background or background-image property. Also, make sure your HTML element has a defined height and width ; otherwise, it might be invisible! Q: Can I use color names instead of Hex codes? A: Yes! You can use standard names like red , blue , papayawhip , or mintcream . However, Hex codes (like #ff5733 ) allow for precise color matching. Q: How do I make a gradient transparent? A: Use RGBA values. The last number in rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) controls opacity (0 is transparent, 1 is solid). Example: linear-gradient(to bottom, red, rgba(255, 0, 0, 0)) fades from red to invisible. Q: Do these gradients work on mobile phones? A: Yes, modern CSS gradients are supported by all major mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox on Android/iOS). Q: Can I animate a gradient? A: Yes! By animating the background-position property and making the background-size larger than the element, you can create smooth, moving gradient effects.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions-faq","text":"Here are answers to common questions about using CSS Gradients.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"},{"location":"faq/#q-why-is-my-gradient-not-showing-up","text":"A: Check your syntax.

By the end, you'll be able to add depth and vibrancy to any web page. Goal Create a \"Sunset Horizon\" linear gradient, a \"Vibrant Orb\" radial gradient, and a \"Rainbow Wheel\" conic gradient. Step 1: Create a Linear Gradient (The Sunset) Linear gradients flow in a straight line. We will create a warm sunset effect. Create the HTML Container: Add a div with the class gradient-sunset to your HTML file. html <div class=\"gradient-sunset\"></div> Add the CSS: In your CSS file, add the following code. It defines a width, height, and the linear gradient. css .gradient-sunset { width: 400px; height: 200px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff7e5f, #feb47b 25%, #fd1d1d 50%, #fdb321 75%, #ff7e5f); border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); } Live Preview: Step 2: Create a Radial Gradient (The Orb) Radial gradients start from a center point. Let's make a glowing orb. Create the HTML Container: Add a div with text inside. html <div class=\"gradient-orb\">Radiate!</div> Add the CSS: css .gradient-orb { width: 300px; height: 300px; background: radial-gradient(ellipse at center, #56ab2f, #a8e6cf 40%, #88d8a3 70%, #f0f8ff); border-radius: 50%; /* Makes it a perfect circle */ display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; color: white; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; } Live Preview: Radiate! Step 3: Create a Conic Gradient (The Rainbow) Conic gradients rotate around a center, perfect for color wheels. Create the HTML Container: html <div class=\"gradient-rainbow\"></div> Add the CSS: css .gradient-rainbow { width: 300px; height: 300px; background: conic-gradient(from 0deg, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, red); border-radius: 50%; } Live Preview: Next Steps Try combining these techniques! You can layer gradients (separating them with commas) or animate them using @keyframes to create moving backgrounds.","title":"Your First Tutorial"},{"location":"first-steps-tutorial/#your-first-tutorial-making-beautiful-gradients","text":"In this tutorial, you will learn how to create three stunning types of CSS gradients.

Linear Gradients What it is: A transition of colors along a straight line. Use it for: Backgrounds, buttons, and progress bars. Example: background: linear-gradient(to right, blue, green); Live Preview: This creates a flow from left (blue) to right (green). Radial Gradients What it is: A transition that radiates from a central point. Use it for: Spotlights, sun effects, or drawing focus to a specific element. Example: background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, black); Live Preview: This creates a yellow center fading into a black edge. Conic Gradients What it is: A color transition rotated around a center point, like a clock face. Use it for: Pie charts, color wheels, and metallic reflections. Example: background: conic-gradient(red, blue, red); Live Preview: Performance & Accessibility Fast Loading: Gradients are generated by code, so they load instantly compared to large image files. Scalable: They look sharp on any screen size, from watches to large monitors. Accessible: You can easily tweak contrast to ensure text remains readable.","title":"Key Features"},{"location":"key-features/#exploring-key-features","text":"The CSS Gradients application empowers you with three distinct tools to shape light and color.","title":"Exploring Key Features"},{"location":"key-features/#linear-gradients","text":"What it is: A transition of colors along a straight line.
