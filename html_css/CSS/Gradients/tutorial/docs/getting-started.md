# Getting Started

Ready to start painting with code? Follow these simple steps to set up the CSS Gradients application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
*   A text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad).
*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).

## Setup Steps

1.  **Locate the Project Files**
    Navigate to the `Gradients/` folder in the project directory. You should see files like `linearGradient.html`, `radialGradient.html`, and `styles.css`.

2.  **Open an HTML File**
    Double-click on `linearGradient.html` to open it in your web browser. You will see a live preview of a linear gradient.

3.  **Open the Code**
    Right-click the same file (`linearGradient.html`) and select "Open with" -> [Your Text Editor]. Do the same for `styles.css`.

4.  **Edit and Refresh**
    Change a color code in `styles.css` (e.g., change `red` to `blue`), save the file, and refresh your browser. Watch the gradient change instantly!

You are now ready to create your own designs.
