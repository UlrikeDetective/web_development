# Exploring Key Features

The CSS Gradients application empowers you with three distinct tools to shape light and color.

## Linear Gradients
**What it is:** A transition of colors along a straight line.
**Use it for:** Backgrounds, buttons, and progress bars.
**Example:**
```css
background: linear-gradient(to right, blue, green);
```
**Live Preview:**
<div style="width: 100%; height: 100px; background: linear-gradient(to right, blue, green); margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

This creates a flow from left (blue) to right (green).

## Radial Gradients
**What it is:** A transition that radiates from a central point.
**Use it for:** Spotlights, sun effects, or drawing focus to a specific element.
**Example:**
```css
background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, black);
```
**Live Preview:**
<div style="width: 100%; height: 200px; background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, black); margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

This creates a yellow center fading into a black edge.

## Conic Gradients
**What it is:** A color transition rotated around a center point, like a clock face.
**Use it for:** Pie charts, color wheels, and metallic reflections.
**Example:**
```css
background: conic-gradient(red, blue, red);
```
**Live Preview:**
<div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background: conic-gradient(red, blue, red); border-radius: 50%; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

## Performance & Accessibility
*   **Fast Loading:** Gradients are generated by code, so they load instantly compared to large image files.
*   **Scalable:** They look sharp on any screen size, from watches to large monitors.
*   **Accessible:** You can easily tweak contrast to ensure text remains readable.
