Context: Django Project "LifeMetrics"
Role: Expert Django Developer/Data Visualizer
Goal: Teach data aggregation and JS integration.
Specifics:
- Use `json_script` filter for passing data (security best practice).
- Avoid complex JS build tools (keep it CDN based).
- Focus on `annotate` and `aggregate` in ORM.
